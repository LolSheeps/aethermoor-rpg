# Quantum Fist

*"I punch through possibilities until I find the one where you lose"*

Reality has rules. The Quantum Fist breaks them with their bare hands. These transcendent warriors have merged the discipline of the Aetherfist with the chaos of the Entropist, creating a fighting style that exists in multiple dimensions simultaneously. They don't just strike opponents—they strike all possible versions of them across infinite timelines.

To qualify for Quantum Fist:
- Minimum level 8 (Epic tier)

## Core Features

### Quantum Superposition
You exist in multiple states until observed, then choose which is real.

**Effect:**
- Each round, exist in 1d4+1 positions simultaneously
- Attackers must guess which you is real
- Can attack from any position
- Take actions from multiple positions
- When hit, collapse to one position (your choice)

This isn't illusion—you literally exist in multiple places.

**Champion Feat:** Control number of positions (2-5).  
**Epic Feat:** Never fully collapse—always partially elsewhere.

### Probability Strike
Your fists hit across dimensions, striking every possible version of the target.

**Effect:**
- Unarmed strikes deal damage based on probability
- Roll 1d6 with each hit:
  - 1: Regular damage
  - 2-3: Hit twice
  - 4-5: Hit all possible locations (can't be dodged)
  - 6: Hit across time (damage past and future versions)
- Critical hits cascade through realities

**Champion Feat:** Choose the probability result.  
**Epic Feat:** Every strike hits infinite versions for escalating damage.

## Quantum Fist Talents

### Schrödinger's Stance
You're simultaneously in all possible combat stances.

**Effect:**
- Have all stance benefits at once:
  - Offensive: +2 attack
  - Defensive: +2 all defenses
  - Mobile: +10 movement
  - Concentrated: +2 damage per die
- When observed closely, must choose one (until unobserved)

**Champion Feat:** Observation doesn't force collapse.  
**Epic Feat:** Create new stances that shouldn't exist.

### Temporal Kombat
You fight across multiple timestreams simultaneously.

**Effect:**
- Your attacks might hit before you throw them
- Can dodge by not being there yet
- Build up temporal charges from combat
- Spend charges to:
  - Undo one action
  - Take extra turn in past
  - Skip enemy turn
  - Fight future battles now

**Champion Feat:** See all possible fight outcomes while fighting.  
**Epic Feat:** Win fights that already happened retroactively.

### Chaos Kata
Your martial arts incorporate pure randomness as a technique.

**Effect:**
- Each attack uses random martial art:
  - Roll 1d6 for style (each has benefits)
  - Can't use same style twice in a row
  - Critical failure becomes critical success
  - Patterns actively refuse to form
- Enemies can't learn or predict your moves

**Champion Feat:** Invent new martial arts mid-combat.  
**Epic Feat:** Chaos style—all styles at once.

### Dimensional Fist
Your strikes phase through dimensions to hit from inside.

**Effect:**
- Ignore armor and shields completely
- Can punch abstract concepts:
  - Hit someone's pride
  - Strike their plans
  - Punch their magic
  - Attack their existence
- Fists exist in multiple dimensions always

**Champion Feat:** Punch things that don't exist yet.  
**Epic Feat:** Conceptual knockout—defeat ideas themselves.

### Uncertainty Principle
The more precisely enemies know your position, the less they know your velocity (and vice versa).

**Effect:**
- Standing still: Unhittable but can't move
- Moving fast: Easy to hit but incredible speed
- Balance between creates advantages:
  - Medium speed/defense optimal
  - Enemies suffer penalties trying to track
  - You always know optimal balance

**Champion Feat:** Force uncertainty on others.  
**Epic Feat:** Exist as probability cloud—never fully anywhere.

### Quantum Entanglement
You become quantumly entangled with struck opponents.

**Effect:**
- What happens to you happens to them
- Share damage taken (split evenly)
- When you move, they move
- Status effects transfer between you
- Can maintain multiple entanglements

**Champion Feat:** Selective entanglement—choose what transfers.  
**Epic Feat:** Entangle with concepts—link to fear itself, etc.

## Playing a Quantum Fist

Quantum Fists are reality-breaking martial artists who turn combat into a philosophical exercise. You're never quite where enemies think you are, and your strikes come from angles that don't exist. Combat becomes a dance through possibilities where only you know the steps.

You excel at single combat but can handle groups by existing in multiple places. Your unpredictability makes you nearly impossible to counter, but your own chaotic nature means plans rarely survive contact with your probability field.

## Quantum Fist Advancement

**Level 9:** Choose a second talent from any pool  
**Level 10:** Achieve Quantum Consciousness—you exist as a fighting technique across all realities. Every martial artist who reaches enlightenment briefly becomes you. You can manifest wherever combat philosophy is discussed.

## The Price of Uncertainty

Quantum Fists pay for their power:
- Identity becomes fluid—who are you across realities?
- Can't form lasting relationships (too many versions)
- Memory becomes uncertain—which timeline was real?
- Existence itself becomes exhausting
- Sometimes punch yourself from other timelines

## Campaign Integration

Quantum Fists work best in:
- High-magic settings that can handle reality breaks
- Campaigns with planar travel
- Stories exploring identity and possibility
- Combat-focused adventures
- Surreal or philosophical themes

They struggle in:
- Low-magic, gritty settings
- Campaigns requiring stable identity
- Social intrigue (too unpredictable)
- Settings with rigid physics

## Relationships

- **Other Quantum Fists:** May be the same person
- **Entropists:** Kindred spirits of chaos
- **Aetherfists:** Horrified at what you've become
- **The Sleeper:** You might be its dream of fighting
- **Reality:** Increasingly optional
