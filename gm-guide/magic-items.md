## Creating Custom Magic Items

When creating new items for Aethermoor, consider:

### Industrial Integration
- How does it blend magic and technology?
- What faction would create this?
- Does it require Aether to function?
- What are its industrial-age side effects?

### Tier Guidelines
- **Apprentice:** +1 bonuses, minor effects, common quirks
- **Journeyman:** +2 bonuses, significant powers, strong quirks  
- **Master:** +3 bonuses, game-changing effects, overwhelming quirks

### Quirk Design
Quirks should:
- Reflect the item's origin
- Create roleplaying opportunities
- Occasionally cause complications
- Never completely cripple the character

### Remember
Magic items in Aethermoor tell stories. Each one represents the collision of old magic and new industry, carrying both the promise of progress and the weight of consequence. Use them not just as power-ups but as narrative devices that tie characters deeper into the world's conflicts and mysteries.
