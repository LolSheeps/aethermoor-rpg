# Factions in Play: A Storytelling Guide

*The six factions of Aethermoor aren't just background lore—they're the engine that drives conflict, creates opportunities, and gives players meaningful choices. This guide will help you bring these organizations to life at your table, making them feel like living entities with goals, resources, and complicated relationships.*

## Understanding Faction Dynamics

### The Core Conflicts
Each faction opposes and allies with others in complex ways:

```
Cogwright Assembly ←→ Verdant Covenant (Progress vs. Nature)
Iron Dominion ←→ Crimson Circle (Order vs. Death)
Aetheric Parliament ←→ Mercantile Syndicate (Law vs. Profit)
```

But it's never that simple:
- The Assembly needs Covenant herbs for alchemical research
- The Dominion uses Circle necromancers for intelligence gathering
- The Parliament requires Syndicate funding for enforcement

### Living Organizations
Factions aren't monoliths. They contain:
- **Moderates** seeking compromise and profit
- **Extremists** pushing aggressive agendas
- **Reformers** trying to change from within
- **Opportunists** using the faction for personal gain
- **True Believers** embodying faction ideals

## Making Factions Personal

### The Face System
Give each faction at least three faces:
1. **The Contact** - Low-level, directly interacts with PCs
2. **The Power** - Mid-level, makes local decisions
3. **The Symbol** - High-level, embodies faction ideals

**Example - Cogwright Assembly:**
- **Contact:** Vera, enthusiastic junior engineer who hires PCs for "field testing"
- **Power:** Director Ironsmith, pragmatic factory owner balancing progress and profit
- **Symbol:** Marina Gearwright herself, brilliant but increasingly detached from humanity

### Faction Representatives Should Be:
- **Complicated:** Good people in "evil" factions, vice versa
- **Memorable:** Distinct voices, mannerisms, goals
- **Recurring:** Build relationships over time
- **Vulnerable:** Can be influenced, threatened, befriended

## Faction Mission Structure

### Tier 1: Direct Employment
The party works explicitly for a faction:

**Mission Types:**
- **Retrieval:** "Acquire this Aether sample/artifact/person"
- **Sabotage:** "Disable their factory/ritual/trade route"
- **Protection:** "Guard this shipment/VIP/location"
- **Investigation:** "Find out who's stealing/spying/killing"
- **Negotiation:** "Convince them to accept our terms"

**Complications:**
- The target is sympathetic
- Another faction interferes
- The mission isn't what it seems
- Moral boundaries get pushed
- Success has unintended consequences

### Tier 2: Caught in the Middle
The party must navigate between faction interests:

**Scenarios:**
- Two factions want the same thing
- Party has information multiple factions need
- Helping one faction hurts another
- Personal relationships conflict with faction goals
- "Neutral" ground doesn't exist

**Example:** *The party discovers an untapped Aether deposit. The Assembly wants to mine it, the Covenant wants to preserve it, the Syndicate wants to profit from it, and something ancient sleeps beneath it.*

### Tier 3: Shadow Games
Factions war through proxies and deniable assets:

**Elements:**
- False flag operations
- Double agents everywhere
- Today's ally, tomorrow's enemy
- Information as ammunition
- Victories that feel like defeats

**Example:** *The party is hired by "merchants" to raid a Dominion supply depot. Success reveals their employers were Circle agents, and the supplies were medical aid for a plague the Circle started.*

## The Faction Turn

Between sessions, factions act:

### The Faction Action Roll
For each faction involved in current events, roll 2d6:
- **2-3:** Major setback
- **4-5:** Minor setback  
- **6-8:** Status quo maintained
- **9-10:** Minor advancement
- **11-12:** Major advancement

Modify by:
- **+1** if PCs recently helped
- **-1** if PCs recently hindered
- **+1** if faction has resource advantage
- **-1** if faction overextended

### Faction Consequences
Show the results through:
- **Newspaper headlines**
- **Changed NPC attitudes**
- **Resource availability**
- **Territory control**
- **Public opinion shifts**

## Faction Relationships and Reputation

### Tracking Standing
Use a simple scale for each faction:
- **-3:** Kill on sight
- **-2:** Active enemy
- **-1:** Distrusted
- **0:** Unknown/neutral
- **+1:** Known associate
- **+2:** Trusted ally
- **+3:** Inner circle

### Reputation Consequences

**Positive Standing:**
- Access to faction resources
- Safe houses and support
- Information networks
- Specialized equipment
- Political protection

**Negative Standing:**
- Harassment and obstacles
- Assassination attempts  
- Economic warfare
- Social ostracization
- Active hunting

### The Ripple Effect
Actions affect multiple factions:
- Help Assembly, anger Covenant
- Rob Syndicate, please their competitors
- Expose Parliament corruption, enable Circle operations

Always show these ripples through concrete changes.

## Running Faction Politics

### Show, Don't Exposit
Instead of: "The Assembly is fighting the Covenant"
Show: "The morning newspaper shows another 'industrial accident' at an Assembly factory near Covenant territory. Your Assembly contact looks worried."

### Every Action Has Sponsors
When players do anything significant, ask:
- Who benefits from this?
- Who's harmed by this?
- Who will claim credit?
- Who will seek revenge?

### Make It Personal
Faction conflicts work best when:
- Players care about people on both sides
- Victories have costs
- Enemies have reasonable motivations
- Friends ask uncomfortable favors

### The Neutral Myth
In Aethermoor, neutrality is:
- Expensive (everyone wants you aligned)
- Suspicious (what are you hiding?)
- Temporary (events force choices)
- Itself a position (profiting from conflict)

## Campaign Seeds

### "The Double Agent"
PCs work for one faction while secretly serving another. How long can they maintain the deception? What happens when both give conflicting orders?

### "The Peace Summit"
All six factions send representatives to negotiate. PCs provide security. Everyone has secret agendas. Success prevents war but requires compromise.

### "The Faction Schism"
One faction splits into reformers vs. traditionalists. PCs must choose sides as civil war threatens. Yesterday's allies become today's enemies.

### "The Seventh Faction"
A new power emerges (awakened constructs? The Sleeper cult? Indigenous alliance?). Existing factions must adapt as the board changes.

## Remember

Factions are tools for creating drama, not straightjackets for limiting options. They should:
- Create opportunities, not just obstacles
- Evolve based on player actions
- Contain multitudes of opinions
- Generate stories, not lectures

The best faction play makes players feel like their choices matter, their allies are complex, their enemies are understandable, and the world changes based on their actions.

Use factions to ask questions:
- What are you willing to do for power?
- Can you change a system from within?
- When does compromise become complicity?
- What's worth fighting for?
- Who decides what progress means?

The answers your players give through play will shape Aethermoor's future.
