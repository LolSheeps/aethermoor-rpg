# Combat Rules

Combat in Aethermoor is fast, cinematic, and deadly. Whether you're fighting in a factory, defending a frontier town, or clashing with Fey in ancient forests, these rules keep the action moving.

## Starting Combat

### Surprise
If one side surprises the other:
- Surprised creatures don't act in round 1
- Surprised creatures have -4 to defenses in round 1
- After round 1, combat proceeds normally

### Initiative Order
1. Everyone rolls d20 + Initiative bonus
2. Write down the order from highest to lowest
3. Ties go to highest Finesse, then highest level
4. This order stays the same for the entire combat

### The Battlefield
Combat uses abstract positioning:
- **Engaged:** In melee with an enemy
- **Nearby:** Within moving distance (about 30 feet)
- **Far Away:** Requires double move to reach
- **Behind/Above/Below:** Tactical positions matter

## Actions in Combat
