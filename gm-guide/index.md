## GM Philosophy for Aethermoor

### Embrace Moral Complexity
There are no simple villains in Aethermoor:
- Factory owners might be the only employment source
- Nature defenders might doom thousands to poverty
- Progress creates problems while solving others
- Let players navigate these waters themselves

### Show Consequences
Every action ripples outward:
- Industrial success brings environmental cost
- Faction victories create new conflicts
- Technology changes society fundamentally
- Player choices shape the world's future

### Make It Personal
Abstract conflicts become compelling through people:
- Give factions human faces
- Show how progress affects individuals
- Create NPCs players care about
- Make ideology cost something personal

### Keep Mystery Alive
Not everything needs explanation:
- The Sleeper's nature remains uncertain
- Pre-industrial civilization holds secrets
- Technology and magic blur together
- Some questions have no good answers

- Heroes must decide what tomorrow should look like
