# The Chronicle of Aethermoor

## The Discovery

**Year of Steam 1247 - The Shimmer on the Horizon**

Captain Elara Ironside wasn't looking for a new world. The decorated naval officer was testing the Cogwright Assembly's latest navigation device when her compass needles began spinning wildly. Instead of turning back, she ordered the *Cogwheel's Pride* full steam ahead.

What she found changed everything.

Beyond the Mistral Ocean lay an untouched continent shrouded in clouds that glowed from within. But the true discovery wasn't the land—it was what thrummed beneath its soil, sparkled in its rivers, and hung heavy in its very air.

**Aether.**

## The Aether Rush

**Year of Steam 1247-1248 - The World Changes**

### First Contact
The first prospectors called it "liquid lightning." Scientists named it "crystallized possibility." Industrialists simply called it "the future."

Aether was energy made manifest—a substance that could:
- Power machines for months without refueling
- Enhance magical spells beyond previous limits
- Blur the boundaries between technology and sorcery
- Transform the impossible into the inevitable

### The Fleet Launches
Within six months of Ironside's return:
- **10,000** colonists sailed for Aethermoor
- **Six major expeditions** launched simultaneously
- The **Copper Coast** was founded and named
- First **Aether refineries** began operation

### The Factions Form
From the chaos of the rush, six major powers emerged:
- **The Cogwright Assembly** - First to arrive with extraction technology
- **The Iron Dominion** - Brought military force to claim territory
- **The Mercantile Syndicate** - Financed expeditions for percentages
- **The Aetheric Parliament** - Insisted on magical regulation
- **The Verdant Covenant** - Warned of environmental destruction
- **The Crimson Circle** - Worked in shadows from the beginning

## The Fey Revelation

**Year of Steam 1248 - We Are Not Alone**

### First Encounters
Colonists initially dismissed reports:
- "Lights in the forest" - explained as swamp gas
- "Whispering trees" - attributed to wind
- "Vanishing scouts" - blamed on desertion
- "Living forests" - called prospector madness

### The Autumn Knight's Declaration
Everything changed when the Autumn Knight appeared in New Fortune's main square, his armor of golden leaves gleaming, his voice carrying impossible distances:

*"You dig into the dreams of a sleeping god. Each crystal you steal is a nightmare prevented, a possibility destroyed. We offered you wonder. You chose plunder. Now you choose war."*

He vanished, leaving only fallen leaves that crumbled to ash.

### Understanding the Fey
We learned too late:
- The Fey had dwelt in Aethermoor since before human memory
- Aether wasn't fuel to them—it was the blood of the land
- They existed partially in dream, partially in reality
- Our mining was literally killing their world
