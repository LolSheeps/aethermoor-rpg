# Wayfinder

*The industrial age pushes ever outward, but someone must scout the path. Wayfinders bridge the gap between civilization and wilderness, equally at home in both yet belonging fully to neither. They are guides, hunters, scouts, and survivors—the ones who ensure expeditions return and settlements survive their first winter.*

*Whether blazing trails for the Assembly's surveys, protecting Covenant sacred sites, or operating as independent guides for hire, Wayfinders possess skills that no amount of technological progress can replace.*
