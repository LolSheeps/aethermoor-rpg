# Vanguard

*First in, last out, always forward. Vanguards are the tip of the spear, the edge of the blade, the point where civilization meets its enemies. They don't hold lines---they shatter them. They don't defend positions---they take them.*

*Whether serving as Dominion shock troops, Syndicate enforcers, or independent warriors-for-hire, Vanguards epitomize aggressive combat supremacy. They've studied war as both art and science, mastering techniques that turn momentum into murder.*
