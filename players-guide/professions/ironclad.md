title: Ironclad - Steam-Powered Tank
---

# Ironclad

*The grinding of gears drowns out their screams. The hiss of steam marks their terror. When an Ironclad takes the field, armies learn what it means to face the future of warfare. These walking fortresses combine the best of magical enhancement and industrial engineering, turning soldiers into unstoppable engines of destruction.*

*Whether serving as line-breakers for the Iron Dominion, protecting Cogwright facilities, or operating as heavily-armored mercenaries, Ironclads represent the pinnacle of defensive technology. Inside their steam-powered shells, they are nearly invincible---outside them, merely mortal.*
