## Playing a Forge Saint

Forge Saints blur the line between crafter, priest, and revolutionary. In combat, your blessed equipment and instant fortifications make you invaluable. Out of combat, you're essentially a walking industrial revolution, able to upgrade any society's technology while infusing it with divine purpose.

Your creations aren't just tools—they're religious artifacts that spread your faith. Every item carries a piece of your soul and your faction's ideology. You're particularly powerful in urban/industrial settings where raw materials and workshops abound.

## The Price of Progress

Forge Saints pay for their transformation:
- Compulsion to create constantly (idle hands are heretical)
- See everything in terms of efficiency and improvement
- Gradually becoming more machine than flesh
- Your creations may develop independence
- Success breeds dependence—societies collapse without you

Forge Saints excel in campaigns featuring:
- City-building or societal development
- Faction politics and religious conflict
- Industrial revolution themes
- Crafting and equipment focus
- Progress vs. tradition conflicts

- Societies that reject progress
