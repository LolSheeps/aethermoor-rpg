# Primordial Sovereign

*"The elements don't serve me. They recognize their rightful ruler"*

Before nations, before laws, before civilization itself, the elements ruled. The Primordial Sovereign hasn't just mastered elemental magic—they've claimed the throne left vacant since the dawn of time. Through fusion of raw magical power and absolute conviction of authority, they become living embodiments of elemental sovereignty, commanding fire, water, earth, and air as a monarch commands subjects.

## Playing a Primordial Sovereign

Primordial Sovereigns don't cast spells—they issue royal decrees to reality. In combat, you reshape the battlefield to your advantage while commanding elemental subjects. Your former crusader conviction now manifests as absolute certainty in your right to rule.

You're most powerful in areas with strong elemental presence but can impose your sovereignty anywhere. Social situations become royal audiences, and you cannot help but treat everyone as subjects or rival monarchs.

## Primordial Sovereign Advancement

**Level 9:** Choose a second talent from any pool  
**Level 10:** Achieve Eternal Reign—you become one with the concept of elemental rulership. Your kingdom expands across all planes where elements exist. Death merely transitions you to ruling from the elemental courts directly.

## The Price of the Crown

Primordial Sovereigns pay for power:
- Cannot act without regal bearing
- Elements constantly petition for attention
- Elemental politics consume your thoughts
- Loneliness of absolute power
- Realm requires constant management

## Campaign Integration

Primordial Sovereigns excel in:
- Environmental challenges
- Planar travel campaigns
- Kingdom building scenarios
- Divine politics stories
- Natural disaster adventures

They struggle with:
- Subtle intrigue
- Technology-focused settings
- Egalitarian societies
- Indoor/urban limitations

## Relationships

- **Elementalists:** Awed subjects or jealous rivals
- **Crusaders:** Confused by elemental "cause"
- **Druids:** See you as ultimate natural authority
- **Other Sovereigns:** Complex royal politics
- **Elemental planes:** Your true home calling
