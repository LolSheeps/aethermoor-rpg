# Bestiary: Epic Tier

*At the pinnacle of power, heroes face the ultimate expressions of Aethermoor's industrial transformation. These creatures embody the fundamental conflicts of the age—the titan-forged Masterwork that questions its purpose, the Aether Dragon born from pure magical pollution, and most terrifying of all, the Sleeper's Herald, first sign of what lies beneath.*
