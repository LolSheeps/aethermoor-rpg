# Aetherfist

*Where others channel Aether through machines or spells, the Aetherfist becomes a living conduit. Through meditation, training, and dangerous experimentation, they've learned to circulate raw magical energy through their bodies like blood. Every punch cracks reality. Every kick bends space. Every breath draws power from the industrial world's most precious resource.*

*Whether serving as Parliament enforcers, Assembly test subjects, or independent masters seeking perfection, Aetherfists represent the marriage of ancient martial arts and cutting-edge magical theory.*
