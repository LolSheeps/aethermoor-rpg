# Game Rules

Learn to play Aethermoor using the Archmage Engine—a fast, flexible d20 system designed for cinematic action.

## Core Rules

### [Basic Rules](basic-rules.md)
Everything you need to know to start playing:
- The d20 mechanic
- Ability scores and modifiers
- Making skill checks
- Core game concepts

### [Combat Rules](combat.md)
Fast-paced battles in the industrial frontier:
- Initiative and turns
- Actions and movement
- The escalation die
- Damage and healing

## Quick Start

**New to RPGs?** Start with [Basic Rules](basic-rules.md) and don't worry about memorizing everything—you'll learn as you play.

**Experienced gamer?** The Archmage Engine uses familiar d20 mechanics with unique twists like the escalation die and flexible attacks.

## Key Differences from Other Games

### The Escalation Die
Combat gets deadlier each round as PCs add an increasing bonus to attacks.

### Abstract Positioning  
No grid needed—use narrative positioning (engaged, nearby, far away).

### Fail Forward
Even failure advances the story in interesting ways.

### One Unique Thing
Every character has something that makes them special in the world.

### Faction Relationships
Your connections to major powers create story opportunities.
