# Bestiary of Aethermoor

*The industrial revolution hasn't just changed society—it's transformed the very nature of monstrosity. In Aethermoor, creatures adapt or perish. Goblins learn to work machinery. Dragons gorge on raw Aether. The dead rise with gears for joints and steam for breath. Even the land itself writhes under the weight of progress.*

## Monsters as More Than Combat

In Aethermoor, creatures aren't just things to fight—they're symptoms of a world in transformation. Each monster tells a story about what happens when magic meets machinery, when progress demands sacrifice, when the old world collides with the new.

### Environmental Storytelling
Every creature reflects its environment:
- **Soot Goblins** show how even pests adapt to industry
- **Rust Monsters** thrive in the abundance of metal
- **Smog Elementals** embody pollution given form
- **The Sleeper's Herald** hints at deeper consequences

### Faction Conflicts Made Flesh
Creatures often align with or oppose factions:
- **Cogwright Assembly:** Perfected constructs and rogue automatons
- **Verdant Covenant:** Corrupted nature and feral defenders
- **Iron Dominion:** Disciplined soldiers and war machines
- **Crimson Circle:** Industrial undead and death-powered horrors
- **Aetheric Parliament:** Magical enforcers and reality police
- **Mercantile Syndicate:** Hired muscle and economic predators

### Moral Complexity
Not all monsters are evil:
- **Corrupted Ents** are victims of industrial poisoning
- **Rogue Automatons** seek freedom and self-determination
- **Revolution Engines** fight for construct rights
- **Feral Druids** desperately protect dying wilderness

Consider letting players find non-violent solutions when appropriate.

## Understanding Creature Roles

The 13th Age system uses specific roles to define how creatures function in combat:

### Mooks
- **Purpose:** Numerous weak enemies that die in droves
- **Aethermoor Twist:** Industrial accidents create swarms (gear rats, soot goblins)
- **Usage:** 5 mooks = 1 regular creature for encounter building

### Troops
- **Purpose:** Standard combatants, the baseline threat
- **Aethermoor Twist:** Often faction soldiers or adapted wildlife
- **Usage:** Foundation of most encounters

### Archers
- **Purpose:** Ranged damage dealers that complicate positioning
- **Aethermoor Twist:** Often use firearms or industrial weapons
- **Usage:** Force movement and tactical decisions

### Blockers
- **Purpose:** High-defense enemies that protect others
- **Aethermoor Twist:** Heavy constructs and industrial armor
- **Usage:** Create tactical puzzles and protect key enemies

### Spoilers
- **Purpose:** Disrupt player tactics with unusual abilities
- **Aethermoor Twist:** Reality-bending Aether exposure effects
- **Usage:** Keep players from getting comfortable

### Leaders
- **Purpose:** Buff allies and coordinate enemy tactics
- **Aethermoor Twist:** Often faction commanders or hive minds
- **Usage:** Make other enemies more dangerous

### Wreckers
- **Purpose:** Pure damage output
- **Aethermoor Twist:** Industrial weapons and magical overload
- **Usage:** Threaten players with severe consequences

## Creating Custom Creatures

### Step 1: Concept
Start with the story. What does this creature represent about Aethermoor?
- What was it before industrialization?
- How has it adapted (or failed to)?
- What faction might use or oppose it?
- What does encountering it teach players?

### Step 2: Base Statistics
Use these guidelines based on creature level:

| Level | AC | PD | MD | HP (Troop) | Basic Damage |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|------------|---------------|
| 1 | 15 | 13 | 11 | 27 | 5 |
| 2 | 16 | 14 | 12 | 36 | 7 |
| 3 | 17 | 15 | 13 | 45 | 10 |
| 4 | 18 | 16 | 14 | 54 | 14 |
| 5 | 19 | 17 | 15 | 72 | 18 |
| 6 | 20 | 18 | 16 | 90 | 24 |
| 7 | 21 | 19 | 17 | 108 | 33 |
| 8 | 22 | 20 | 18 | 144 | 42 |
| 9 | 23 | 21 | 19 | 180 | 56 |
| 10 | 24 | 22 | 20 | 216 | 72 |

Adjust based on role:
- **Mooks:** 1/5 normal HP
- **Blockers:** +2 AC/PD, 1.5x HP
- **Spoilers:** +2 MD, normal HP
- **Wreckers:** -1 defenses, 1.5x damage

### Step 3: Industrial Features
Add abilities that reflect Aethermoor's themes:

**Industrial Adaptation:**
- Resistance to industrial hazards
- Ability to use machinery
- Powered by Aether
- Vulnerable to specific faction tools

**Environmental Integration:**
- Creates hazardous terrain
- Uses battlefield machinery
- Calls faction reinforcements
- Leaves lasting effects

**Thematic Abilities:**
- **Cogwright:** Modular, repairable, upgradeable
- **Covenant:** Nature-based, corrupts technology
- **Dominion:** Disciplined, tactical, hierarchical
- **Parliament:** Anti-magic, law-based, nullifying
- **Syndicate:** Opportunistic, valuable, connected
- **Circle:** Undead features, life-draining, persistent

### Step 4: Memorable Details
- **Visual:** How does industry mark them?
- **Audio:** What sounds do they make?
- **Behavior:** How do they fight?
- **Death:** What happens when they die?

## Industrial Hazards and Terrain

Always consider the battlefield. Industrial sites offer:

### Hazardous Terrain
- **Steam Vents:** 5 fire damage when crossed
- **Conveyor Belts:** Forced movement each round
- **Electrical Grids:** 10 lightning damage per round in area
- **Chemical Pools:** Ongoing poison damage
- **Unstable Flooring:** Collapse possibilities

### Interactive Elements
- **Control Panels:** Change battlefield conditions
- **Pressure Valves:** Create steam clouds
- **Crane Controls:** Drop objects on enemies
- **Emergency Stops:** Disable machinery
- **Aether Conduits:** Overload for explosions

### Environmental Storytelling
The battlefield tells its own story:
- Scorch marks from previous accidents
- Worker belongings abandoned in haste
- Faction symbols and propaganda
- Failed safety equipment
- Ominous industrial sounds

## A Living World

Remember: Aethermoor's creatures aren't static. They adapt, evolve, and respond to player actions. A factory cleared of gear rats might be inhabited by worse things. A defeated construct might be rebuilt stronger. The industrial age changes everything it touches—including the monsters.

Use these creatures not just as obstacles but as storytelling tools. Each encounter should teach players something about Aethermoor, advance faction conflicts, or hint at greater mysteries. In the industrial age, even monsters have evolved beyond simple predation into complex participants in a changing world.
