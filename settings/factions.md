# The Six Factions

In Aethermoor, your faction relationships define your opportunities and obstacles. Each faction represents a different vision for the continent's future.

## How Faction Relationships Work

You have 3 relationship points to distribute (positive, negative, or conflicted):
- **Positive (+):** You actively serve this faction
- **Conflicted (±):** Complicated relationship with benefits and drawbacks  
- **Negative (−):** You oppose this faction and they oppose you

At the start of each session, roll 1d6 per relationship point. On 5-6, that faction influences the story.
