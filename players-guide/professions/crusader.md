# Crusader

*In an age of moral complexity and industrial compromise, Crusaders stand as beacons of absolute conviction. They don't see shades of gray—only right and wrong, just and unjust, their cause and everything that stands against it. Armed with unwavering faith and righteous fury, they cut through moral ambiguity with the sharp edge of certainty.*

*Whether championing the Parliament's law, the Dominion's order, or the Covenant's natural harmony, Crusaders prove that true belief can manifest as tangible power in a world hungry for heroes.*
