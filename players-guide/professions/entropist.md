title: Entropist - Chaos Mage

# Entropist

*In a world racing toward industrial order, Entropists embrace the fundamental chaos that lurks beneath reality's thin veneer. They understand that rules are suggestions, physics is negotiable, and probability is just another system to hack. Every spell they cast is a roll of cosmic dice, every battle a dance with disaster.*

*Whether serving as wildcards for any faction desperate enough to employ them, or operating as agents of pure chaos, Entropists remind everyone that no matter how much we try to control the future, entropy always wins.*
