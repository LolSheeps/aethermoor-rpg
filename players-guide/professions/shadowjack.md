title: Shadowjack - Industrial Spy
---

# Shadowjack

*In the industrial age, information is ammunition and secrets are currency. The Shadowjack trades in both. Part spy, part assassin, part saboteur, they are the unseen hand that tilts the scales of power. In a world of steam and steel, they are smoke and shadow.*

*Whether stealing corporate secrets for the Syndicate, eliminating threats for the Dominion, or playing all sides as freelance operatives, Shadowjacks thrive where ethics go to die and money talks loudest.*
