## Playing a War Conductor

War Conductors transform chaotic melees into orchestrated performances. You stand back from direct combat, instead positioning allies like notes on a staff. Your commands carry supernatural weight, and battles flow according to your vision.

You excel at large-scale conflicts where your symphonic approach shines, but even small skirmishes become elaborate performances. Social situations become recitals, negotiations become duets, and you can't help but hear the music in everything.

## War Conductor Advancement

**Level 9:** Choose a second talent from any pool  
**Level 10:** Become the Eternal Symphony—warfare itself follows your composition across all realities. Every battle everywhere unconsciously follows patterns you've established. You exist as the fundamental rhythm of conflict.

## The Price of Performance

War Conductors pay for their art:
- Cannot tolerate discord—off-key allies pain you
- Compulsive need to orchestrate everything
- Hear constant music others can't
- Perfect performances become obsession
- Identity dissolves into the eternal song

## Campaign Integration

War Conductors shine in:
- Large-scale military campaigns
- Battles with numerous combatants
- Campaigns emphasizing coordination
- Stories exploring art and war
- Epic, theatrical adventures

They struggle with:
- Solo operations
- Chaotic, unplanned encounters
- Stealth missions (too dramatic)
- Tone-deaf allies

## Relationships

- **Military forces:** Awed by supernatural coordination
- **Artists:** Horrified fascination with combat aesthetics
- **Marshal colleagues:** Respect tinged with incomprehension
- **Luminary peers:** Jealous of ultimate performance
- **Other War Conductors:** Dueling symphonies of destruction
