# Storm Prophet

*"I don't predict the weather—I am the weather"*

Where others see contradiction between nature's patterns and chaos theory, the Storm Prophet sees truth. These transcendent beings understand that nature itself is chaos—every peaceful meadow hides potential catastrophe, every storm follows invisible mathematics. They are walking disasters who speak for the hurricane's eye, ambassadors between order and entropy.

- No season (temporal stasis)

**Champion Feat:** Personal seasons—you're always in chosen season.  
**Epic Feat:** Seasonal warfare—weaponize transitions.

## Playing a Storm Prophet

Storm Prophets are forces of nature—literally. In combat, you reshape the battlefield constantly, creating environmental hazards that follow their own chaotic rules. Your former Wayfinder training lets you navigate the chaos while your Entropist nature ensures it never quite goes as planned.

You're particularly effective in outdoor environments but can summon weather anywhere. Your presence makes exploration unpredictable—you might call rain in a desert or drought in a rainforest. Social situations become interesting as your emotions manifest meteorologically.

## Storm Prophet Advancement

**Level 9:** Choose a second talent from any pool  
**Level 10:** Become the Storm Eternal—you can no longer be killed by anything natural, and your death would cause regional catastrophe. You exist partially as weather patterns across the continent.

## The Price of Transcendence

Storm Prophets pay for their power:
- Cannot stay in civilized areas long (weather destroys them)
- Emotions manifest uncontrollably as weather
- Natural disasters are drawn to you
- You're becoming less human, more force of nature
- The line between you and weather blurs

## Campaign Integration

Storm Prophets work best in campaigns where:
- Environmental challenges matter
- The party operates outdoors frequently  
- Collateral damage is acceptable
- Natural/technological conflict is central
- Reality's stability is already questionable

They struggle in:
- Urban-focused campaigns
- Diplomatic scenarios
- Situations requiring subtlety
- Areas where weather can't manifest

## Relationships

- **Verdant Covenant:** Terrified respect—you're nature uncontrolled
- **Cogwright Assembly:** Fascinated horror—you break their models
- **The Sleeper:** Kinship—you might be its dreams of weather
- Other Storm Prophets: Instant hurricane when two meet
