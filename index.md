## What is Aethermoor?

Four years ago, Captain Elara Ironside discovered a new continent across the Mistral Ocean—and with it, Aether, a miraculous substance that powers both magic and machinery. Now six great factions race to claim this frontier, while the native Fey fight desperately to save their dying land.

You are among the latest wave of colonists, revolutionaries, and fortune-seekers to reach these shores. Will you strip-mine the land for profit? Fight to preserve it? Or find a path between progress and preservation?
