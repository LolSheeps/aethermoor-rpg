# Occultist

*Progress demands sacrifice. The industrial age grinds forward, powered by Aether and ambition, but some truths are older than steam engines and darker than coal smoke. Occultists walk the shadowed paths between worlds, trafficking with entities that predate civilization and will outlast it. They know that every invention has a price, every discovery a danger, and that some doors, once opened, can never be closed.*

*Whether serving the Circle's darkest experiments, delving into pre-colonial mysteries, or pursuing personal apotheosis, Occultists remind everyone that knowledge and wisdom are very different things.*

## Class Features

### Forbidden Pacts
You've made deals with things that shouldn't exist, gaining power at terrible prices.

**Effect:** Choose your primary pact (work with GM):
- **The Sleeper:** Dream magic and prophecy, but you help it wake
- **Elder Fey:** Illusion and enchantment, but you owe three favors
- **Void Between:** Teleportation and nullification, but you're partially hollow
- **Dead Stars:** Cosmic power, but you're no longer entirely human
- **The Crimson Patron:** Blood magic, but you hunger for life

Each pact grants specific spells and a terrible price.

**Apprentice Feat:** Secondary pact—two patrons, two prices.  
**Journeyman Feat:** Renegotiate terms—reduce one price temporarily.  
**Master Feat:** Become patron—others make pacts with you.

### Witch's Arsenal
Your magic draws from traditions civilization tried to forget.

**Effect:** You know rituals and hexes:
- **Evil Eye:** Curse target with disadvantage (save ends)
- **Hex:** Ongoing damage that spreads on death
- **Ward:** Protection circles that actually work
- **Divination:** Ask questions of things better left unasked

Rituals take time but create lasting effects. Hexes are quick but draw attention.

**Apprentice Feat:** Rituals can be rushed (with risks).  
**Journeyman Feat:** Layer multiple hexes on same target.  
**Master Feat:** Grand ritual—reshape reality locally.
