# Running Aethermoor

*Welcome to the conductor's seat of the great industrial engine that is Aethermoor. As GM, you're not just running a game—you're managing the collision between progress and tradition, civilization and wilderness, order and chaos. This guide will help you bring the unique flavor of industrial fantasy to your table.*

## The Core Tension

At the heart of every Aethermoor campaign lies a fundamental question: **What price are we willing to pay for progress?**

Every adventure should touch on this theme somehow:
- The factory that provides jobs but poisons the river
- The railroad that connects cities but displaces indigenous peoples  
- The Aether mine that powers civilization but weakens reality
- The progress that promises utopia but delivers dystopia

Don't preach—let players discover these complexities through play.

## Setting the Tone

### Industrial Gothic
Aethermoor blends Victorian industrialism with fantasy adventure. Think:
- Smoke-shrouded cities where gargoyles perch on factory smokestacks
- Gleaming brass and tarnished copper alongside ancient stone
- Gas lamps casting shadows where monsters lurk
- The wealthy in their towers, the poor in their soot

### Magic Meets Machine
Magic hasn't been replaced by technology—it's been industrialized:
- Spell energy powers factories
- Enchantments run on assembly lines
- Wizards work R&D departments
- Magical creatures adapt or die

### Moral Ambiguity
There are no simple villains in Aethermoor:
- The factory owner employing children might be the only thing keeping them from starvation
- The Luddite destroying machines might doom hundreds to unemployment
- The nature defender might be condemning people to pre-industrial misery
- Let players navigate these waters themselves

## Running Faction Politics

The six factions aren't monoliths—they're collections of individuals with varying goals. Use this to create nuanced conflicts:

### Making Factions Personal
- Give each faction a face—NPCs players know and care about
- Show good people in "bad" factions and vice versa
- Let players see the consequences of faction conflicts on ordinary people
- Faction membership should complicate, not simplify, moral choices

### Faction Missions
Adventures can come from:
- **Direct Employment:** Faction hires party for specific goal
- **Caught in the Middle:** Party trapped between faction conflicts
- **Double Agent:** Working for multiple factions simultaneously
- **Independent Action:** Party's goals align with or oppose factions

### Dynamic Relationships
Track how party actions affect faction standings:
- Small actions create ripples
- Major actions shift regional power
- Let players see newspapers reporting their deeds
- Factions remember and respond to past actions

## The Aether Economy

Aether drives everything. Use it to create adventures:

### Aether Complications
- **Shortages:** What happens when the Aether runs out?
- **Contamination:** Corrupted Aether causing mutations
- **Oversaturation:** Too much Aether breaking reality
- **Monopolies:** Who controls the Aether controls the world

### The Sleeper Mystery
Drop hints about what lies beneath:
- Miners hearing whispers in deep tunnels
- Reality glitches near major deposits
- Dreams shared by those who handle raw Aether
- Ancient warnings in dead languages

Don't reveal everything—let mystery build across campaigns.

## Industrial Adventures

### Urban Scenarios
- **Factory Mysteries:** Strange accidents, worker disappearances
- **Corporate Espionage:** Stealing plans, sabotaging competitors
- **Union Conflicts:** Strikes, negotiations, violence
- **Serial Killers:** Using industrial methods for dark purposes
- **Political Intrigue:** Elections, corruption, revolution

### Frontier Scenarios
- **Railroad Expansion:** Protecting construction, dealing with obstacles
- **Boom Towns:** Aether rushes creating instant communities
- **Indigenous Conflicts:** Fey and natives vs. colonization
- **Explorer Expeditions:** Mapping unknown regions
- **Beast Hunts:** Industrial-era monster hunting

### Weird Science
- **Mad Inventors:** Creations that shouldn't exist
- **Experimental Accidents:** When progress goes wrong
- **Ethical Dilemmas:** Science without conscience
- **Temporal Anomalies:** Industrial accidents affecting time
- **Dimensional Breaks:** Aether mining gone too far

## Combat in the Industrial Age

### Environmental Hazards
Every industrial setting offers dangers:
- Steam pipes that can rupture
- Conveyor belts and grinding gears
- Electrical systems and Aether conduits
- Unstable chemicals and explosives
- Heights, confined spaces, and poor visibility

### Mixed Technology Levels
- Not everyone has guns—make firearms special but not dominant
- Magic still matters—blend spells with steam
- Melee remains relevant—close quarters and armor
- Give enemies varied capabilities

### Set Pieces
Industrial locations make great battle arenas:
- Moving train tops
- Active factory floors
- Airship dogfights
- Collapsing mine shafts
- Clock tower interiors

## Social Encounters

### Class Consciousness
Aethermoor has stark class divisions:
- **Upper Class:** Faction leaders, industrial magnates
- **Middle Class:** Skilled workers, shop owners, clerks
- **Working Class:** Factory workers, miners, servants
- **Underclass:** Unemployed, criminals, scavengers

Use class to create roleplaying opportunities and obstacles.

### Information Networks
In the industrial age, information travels:
- Newspapers shape public opinion
- Telegraph speeds communication
- Photographs provide proof
- Rumors spread through factories
- Make information a treasure and weapon

### Urban Navigation
Cities are mazes of:
- Social expectations and fashion
- Legal systems and bureaucracy
- Criminal underworlds
- Exclusive clubs and societies
- Public transportation and traffic

## Pacing Your Campaign

### The March of Progress
Time should matter in Aethermoor:
- Technology advances between adventures
- Faction power shifts monthly
- Seasons affect industrial output
- Progress waits for no one

### Campaign Arcs
Consider these overarching stories:
1. **The Aether Crisis:** Discovering the true cost of industrial power
2. **The Faction War:** Six-way conflict for continental control
3. **The Sleeper Wakes:** Apocalyptic consequences of going too deep
4. **The Revolution:** Overthrowing the industrial order
5. **The New Frontier:** Exploring beyond known Aethermoor

### Session Zero Questions
Ask your players:
- Which faction interests you most? Why?
- How does your character feel about progress?
- What's your relationship with technology and magic?
- What kind of stories excite you in this setting?
- How dark are we comfortable going?

## Unique Mechanics

### Incorporating Professions
Each profession brings flavor:
- Let Artificers modify equipment mid-adventure
- Give Factotums faction-specific benefits
- Allow Marshals to recruit temporary allies
- Enable Shadowjacks to access criminal networks

### Environmental Storytelling
The world tells its own story:
- Soot-stained buildings show industrial growth
- Abandoned machines hint at failed ventures
- Protest graffiti reveals social tensions
- Architecture blends eras uneasily

### Newspapers and Media
Create in-world newspapers featuring:
- Party's exploits (accurately or not)
- Faction propaganda
- Adventure hooks disguised as news
- Price fluctuations and strike announcements
- Society gossip and industrial accidents

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't Make It Modern
Aethermoor isn't steampunk Earth:
- No real-world nations or history
- Technology is magical, not scientific
- Social progress doesn't mirror our timeline
- Keep it fantasy first, industrial second

### Don't Pick Sides
Let players decide who's right:
- Every faction has valid points
- Progress and tradition both have costs
- Present dilemmas, not solutions
- Judge actions, not ideologies

### Don't Forget the Wonder
Amid the grime and moral complexity:
- Flying machines are still miraculous
- Magic remains mysterious
- Wilderness holds beauty
- Hope exists alongside despair
