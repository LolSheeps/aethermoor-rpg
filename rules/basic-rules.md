# Basic Rules

## The Core Mechanic

Almost everything in Aethermoor uses this simple system:

**1. Roll a d20 (20-sided die)**  
**2. Add relevant modifiers**  
**3. Compare to a target number**  
**4. Success or failure tells the story**

### Example
*You want to leap across a gap between factory rooftops*
- Roll d20: You get 13
- Add your Level (+3) and Finesse modifier (+2) = 18 total  
- GM says the Difficulty Class (DC) is 15
- 18 beats 15 - Success! You land safely

## Ability Scores

Your character has six abilities that define their natural talents:

| Ability | Description | Common Uses |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Might** | Physical power | Melee attacks, breaking things |
| **Finesse** | Agility and precision | Ranged attacks, dodging |
| **Vigor** | Health and endurance | Hit points, resisting poison |
| **Ingenuity** | Logic and knowledge | Spellcasting, investigation |
| **Intuition** | Awareness and wisdom | Perception, survival |
| **Presence** | Charisma and leadership | Social interaction, leadership |

### Ability Modifiers

| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| 8-9   | -1       | 14-15 | +2       |
| 10-11 | +0       | 16-17 | +3       |
| 12-13 | +1       | 18+   | +4       |

## Making Checks

### Skill Checks
When you try something challenging:
1. GM sets a Difficulty Class (DC)
2. Roll d20 + Level + Ability Modifier + Job Bonus (if applicable)
3. Meet or beat the DC to succeed

### Standard DCs
- **Easy (DC 10):** Routine tasks
- **Standard (DC 15):** Professional challenge  
- **Hard (DC 20):** Expert difficulty
- **Ridiculously Hard (DC 25):** Nearly impossible

### Natural 20 and Natural 1
- **Natural 20:** Always succeeds, often with style
- **Natural 1:** Always fails, sometimes with complications

## Combat Basics

### Initiative
1. Everyone rolls d20 + Initiative bonus
2. Act in order from highest to lowest
3. Keep this order for the entire fight

### Your Turn
Each turn you can:
- **Move** to anywhere nearby (about 30 feet)
- **Standard Action** (attack, full move, complex ability)
- **Quick Action** (shout, simple ability)
- **Free Actions** (talk, drop item)

### Making an Attack
1. Choose a target
2. Roll d20 + Level + Ability + Weapon bonus
3. Compare to enemy's defense
4. If you hit, roll damage

### The Escalation Die
Starting in round 2:
- Place a d6 showing "1" on the table
- PCs add this number to attacks
- Increase by 1 each round (max 6)
- Makes combat deadlier over time

## Defenses

You have three defenses against different attacks:

### Armor Class (AC)
- Protects against weapon attacks
- Base 10-16 (by armor type) + middle of (Vigor/Finesse/Intuition) + Level

### Physical Defense (PD)  
- Protects against grabs, poisons, explosions
- Base 10-12 (by class) + middle of (Might/Vigor/Finesse) + Level

### Mental Defense (MD)
- Protects against mind control, fear, psychic attacks
- Base 10-12 (by class) + middle of (Ingenuity/Intuition/Presence) + Level

## Hit Points and Healing

### Hit Points
- Represents your ability to keep fighting
- Determined by profession and Vigor modifier
- Increases with level

### Staggered
- At 50% HP or less, you're staggered
- Some abilities only work when staggered
- Enemies may act differently

### Recoveries
- You have 8 recoveries per day (usually)
- Spend them to heal during rests
- Roll your recovery dice + Vigor modifier

### Types of Rest
- **Quick Rest (5 minutes):** Spend recoveries, regain per-battle abilities
- **Full Rest (8 hours):** Regain all recoveries, HP, and daily abilities

## Special Rules

### Advantage and Disadvantage
- **Advantage:** Roll twice, use the higher
- **Disadvantage:** Roll twice, use the lower

### Flexible Attacks
Some abilities trigger based on your attack roll:
- **Natural Even:** 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. on the d20
- **Natural Odd:** 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. on the d20
- **Natural 16+:** 16 or higher on the d20

### Recharge Powers
After each battle, roll d20 for recharge powers:
- **Recharge 16+:** Need 16 or higher to use again
- **Recharge 11+:** Need 11 or higher
- **Recharge 6+:** Need 6 or higher

## Conditions

Common conditions that affect characters:

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Confused** | -4 to attacks, can't use tactics |
| **Dazed** | -4 to attacks |
| **Grabbed** | Can't move, -4 to attacks |
| **Hampered** | Can only make basic attacks |
| **Helpless** | Can be coup de graced |
| **Stuck** | Can't move, save ends |
| **Stunned** | Can't take actions, -4 to defenses |
| **Vulnerable** | Attacks against you crit on 16+ |
| **Weakened** | -4 to attacks and defenses |

*Save Ends:* Roll d20 at end of turn, 11+ removes condition

## Quick Combat Example

**Round 1:**
- Sarah (Ironclad): Rolls 17 initiative
- Marcus (Elementalist): Rolls 12  
- Steam Golem: Rolls 15

**Sarah's Turn:**
- Moves to engage the golem
- Attacks: d20 (14) + Level (2) + Might (3) = 19
- Hits AC 18! Rolls d8+3 = 9 damage

**Golem's Turn:**
- Attacks Sarah: d20 (11) + 7 = 18
- Hits her AC 17! Deals 12 damage

**Marcus's Turn:**
- Casts Lightning Bolt
- Attacks: d20 (16) + Level (2) + Ingenuity (4) = 22  
- Hits! 2d8 lightning damage

**Round 2:** Escalation die starts at 1!
